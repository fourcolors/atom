align=\"center\">\n[![travis][travis-image]][travis-url]\n[![npm][npm-image]][npm-url]\n[![downloads][downloads-image]][downloads-url]\n</p>\n\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/JedWatson/happiness.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/JedWatson/happiness\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/happiness.svg?style=flat\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/happiness\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/happiness.svg?style=flat\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/happiness\n\n[Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) customised to make [us](#maintainers) happy.\n\nThis is a fork of Standard with two changes:\n\n- **Tabs** for indentions\n- **Semicolons** always\n\nIt is called happiness, because we hope that it brings you joy, love and ends strife among your fellow developers.\n\n**Reminder**: Happiness is not for everyone.  Some people will choose to be sad, normal and some might even say \"standard\".\nThat is alright.  A happy person is comfortable with being them and fine to let others be who they want to be.  *\"You do you\"*\n\nIf the information you are looking for is not in this readme, you should take a look at the [Standard readme](https://github.com/feross/standard), it might have what you are looking for.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ npm install happiness\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe easiest way to use JavaScript Happiness Style to check your code is to install it\nglobally as a Node command line program. To do so, simply run the following command in\nyour terminal (flag `-g` installs `happiness` globally on your system, omit it if you want\nto install in the current working directory):\n\n```bash\n$ npm install happiness -g\n```\n\nAfter you've done that you should be able to use the `happiness` program. The simplest use\ncase would be checking the style of all JavaScript files in the current working directory:\n\n```bash\n$ happiness\nError: Use JavaScript happiness Style\n  lib/torrent.js:950:11: Expected '===' and instead saw '=='.\n```\n\nYou can optionally pass in a directory (or directories) using the glob pattern. Be sure to quote paths containing glob patterns so that they are expanded by standard instead of your shell:\n\n```bash\n$ happiness \"src/util/**/*.js\" \"test/**/*.js\"\n```\n\nMany people like to add happiness to their testing setup. To do this, save the packge as a dev dependency and add happiness to your package.json's test script:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install --save-dev happiness\n```\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"happiness && mocha # <- or whatever test runner you use\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** by default `happiness` will look for all files matching the patterns: `**/*.js`, `**/*.jsx`.\n\n## Badge\n\nUse this in one of your projects?
